03/26: Wrote proposal for Monopoly Deal
03/27: Drew out diagram of the three classes (Player, Card, Deck), and their respective subcalsses: 
      
       Player (void act //draw two cards and make three moves) *instance variables: AL _hand, AL of LL of _properties, BST _money)   
           ComputerPlayer
               A (instanceOf CP)
               B (instanceOf CP)
               C (instanceOf CP)
           Me
       Card (int getValue, String getName, boolean inField)
           MoneyCard
           ActionCard
               Rent
               IMB //it's my birthday
               SlyDeal
               ForcedDeal
           PropertyCard
               Blue
               Yellow
               Orange
               Green
               Pink
       Deck (void shuffle)
         
03/28: Refined, changed a few of the methods and instance variables, etc. (Look above)
       Divided work for tonight:
           Julie: PropertyCard
                  MoneyCard
           Alicia: ActionCard
                   Maybe start working on Player
           *Somebody write Card class so we can start working on subclasses
           *Think about how to call on next player, looping, interaction between players, etc. 
03/28: Alicia: Put down draw2 and checkHand methods for player. 
               Created Card and YellowPropertyCard classes and put in basic variables and return methods.
03/29: TO DO:
       PHASE 1: Create all the cards & place in deck randomly (stack)
       PHASE 2: Create Player methods for a turn
       PHASE 3: Make the game playable for 4 players
       PHASE 4: Create the computer players and make single player list
       
       (PHASE1 and PHASE2 can be done simultanetously)
       We are currently on PHASE1 and PHASE2
       
       Julie: Added methods to Card Class, methods and attributes to PropertyCard Class
              Created all of the color classes under property, wrote some main methods
       Alicia: Edited Player Class: added display method, added description attribute to property and money cards.
05/29: Alicia Added SlyDeal class. Created a use method for action cards in Player. 
              Need to work on actually putting the SlyDeal card to use.
05/30: Throw/catch in Player Class (line 51: if the input type is not an integer)
06/01: Alicia: updated Player class. modified methods checkColor and useSlyDeal. 
06/02: UML Diagram
