3/26: Wrote proposal for Monopoly Deal
3/27: Drew out diagram of the three classes (Player, Card, Deck), and their respective subcalsses: 
      
      Player (void act //draw two cards and make three moves) *instance variables: AL _hand, AL of LL of _properties, BST _money)   
          ComputerPlayer
              A (instanceOf CP)
              B (instanceOf CP)
              C (instanceOf CP)
          Me
      Card (int getValue, String getName, boolean inField)
          MoneyCard
          ActionCard
              Rent
              IMB //it's my birthday
              SlyDeal
              ForcedDeal
          PropertyCard
              Blue
              Yellow
              Orange
              Mint
              Pink
      Deck (void shuffle)
         
3/28: Refined, changed a few of the methods and instance variables, etc. (Look above)
      Divided work for tonight:
          Julie: PropertyCard
                 MoneyCard
          Alicia: ActionCard
                  Maybe start working on Player
          *Somebody write Card class so we can start working on subclasses
          *Think about how to call on next player, looping, interaction between players, etc. 
3/28 Alicia 1AM: put down draw2 and checkHand methods for player. Created Card and YellowPropertyCard classes and put in basic variables and return methods.
